This python script is a CLI application.

The random exerciser application chooses a random time, exercise, and repitition count.

The time and repitition count are based on user input.
The goal is to make it customizable so that users can input their own exercises.

Currently this app has some exercises already built in: pushups, situps, jumping jacks, ab rollers,
and mountain climbers.
